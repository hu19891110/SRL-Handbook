Ultimately, for a full understanding of the diagram let as briefly comment possible 
statuses which can be assigned to the submission.

**Accepted (AC)**
  the submission is a correct solution to the problem.
  
**Wrong answer (WA)**
  the submission is incorrect solution. It depends on master judge implementation.
  
**Time limit exceeded (TLE)**
  the submission execution took to long. Again it depends on master judge implementation.
  
**Runtime error (RE)**
  the error occurred during program execution.
  
**Compilation error (CE)**
